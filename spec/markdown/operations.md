## DID Operations

Sidetree-based DIDs support a variety of DID operations, all of which require the DID owner to generate specific data values and cryptographic material. The sections below describe how to perform each type of operation, and how those operations are represented in the CAS-replicated files that are anchored to the underlying ledger system.

While virtually all DID owners will engage User Agent applications on their local devices to perform these operations, most will not generate the anchoring transactions on the underlying ledger. Instead, most users will likely send the anchoring-related operation values they generate to external nodes for anchoring. This is relatively safe, because operations require signatures that an external node cannot forge. The only attack available to a rogue node operator is to not anchor the operations a DID owner sends them. However, the DID owner can detect this (via a scan of subsequent blocks) and send their operation to a different node or do it themselves, if they so desire.

::: note
  This specification does not define an API for sending public DID operation values to third-party Sidetree nodes for external anchoring, as that is an elective activity has no bearing on the technical workings of the protocol, its capabilities, or its security guarantees.
:::

Sidetree Methods MAY choose to expose protocol operation keys in the DID Document.

Sidetree Methods MAY rely on the DID Document data model when verifying protocol operations.

::: warning
  Operations other than Create contain a compact JWS. Dereferencing of key material used to verify the JWS is a DID Method specific concern. Some methods may rely of the DID Document data model, others may rely on an internal data model. Some methods may rely on `kid` of the form `did:example:123#fingerprint`, others may not include a `kid` in the JWS, or its value may be arbitrary. Support for specific `alg` fields is also DID Method specific. Implementers are cautioned to choose support for specific `alg` values carefully.

### Create

Use the following process to generate a Sidetree-based DID:

1. Generate a key pair via the [`KEY_ALGORITHM`](#key-algorithm). The public key ****MUST**** be retained for use as the [_Initial Recovery Public Key_](#initial-recovery-key){id="initial-recovery-key"} portion of the [DID Suffix](#did-suffix), while the the private key ****MUST**** be securely stored for use in subsequent [Recovery](#recovery) operations.
2. Generate and retain a [`COMMITMENT_VALUE`](#commitment-value) for use in the next Recovery operation, herein referred to as [_Initial Recovery Commitment_](#initial-recovery-commitment){id="initial-recovery-commitment"}.
3. Generate a _Recovery Commitment_ hash using the [Hashing Process](#hashing-process) to generate a hash of the [`COMMITMENT_VALUE`](#commitment-value), and retain the resulting hash value for inclusion in an [Anchor File](#anchor-file) (if publication of the DID is desired).
4. Generate and retain a [`COMMITMENT_VALUE`](#commitment-value) for use in the next Update operation, herein referred to as _Update Reveal Value_.
5. Generate an _Update Commitment_ hash by using the [Hashing Process](#hashing-process) to generate a hash of the _Update Reveal Value_, and retain the resulting hash value for inclusion in an [Anchor File](#anchor-file) (if publication of the DID is desired).
6. Generate an encoded representation of the following object using the implementation's [`DATA_ENCODING_SCHEME`](#data-encoding-scheme), herein referred to as the [_Create Operation Delta Object_](#create-delta-object){ id="create-delta-object" }:
    ```json
    {
      "patches": [ PATCH_1, PATCH_2, ... ],
      "update_commitment": HASH_OF_UPDATE_COMMITMENT_VALUE
    }
    ```
    - The object ****MUST**** contain a `patches` property, and its value ****MUST**** be an array of [DID State Patches](#did-state-patches).
    - The object ****MUST**** contain a `update_commitment` property, and its value ****MUST**** be the _Update Commitment_, as described above.
7. Generate an encoded representation of the following object using the implementation's [`DATA_ENCODING_SCHEME`](#data-encoding-scheme), herein referred to as the [_Create Operation Suffix Data Object_](#create-suffix-data-object){ id="create-suffix-data-object" }:
    ```json
    {
      "delta_hash": DELTA_HASH,
      "recovery_key": JWK_OBJECT,
      "recovery_commitment": COMMITMENT_HASH
    }
    ```
    - The object ****MUST**** contain a `delta_hash` property, and its value ****MUST**** be a hash of the decoded [_Create Operation Delta Object_](#create-delta-object) (detailed above), generated via the [Hashing Process](#hashing-process).
    - The object ****MUST**** contain the `recovery_key` property, and its value ****MUST**** be an [IETF RFC 7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) compliant JWK representation of the [_Initial Recovery Public Key_](#initial-recovery-key) (detailed above).
    - The object ****MUST**** contain an `recovery_commitment` property, and its value ****MUST**** be an [_Initial Recovery Commitment_](#initial-recovery-commitment) (detailed above).

::: note
Implementers MAY choose to canonicalize their [_Create Operation Suffix Data Objects_](#create-suffix-data-object) prior applying the [`DATA_ENCODING_SCHEME`](#data-encoding-scheme). This does not affect the outcome or other components in the system that deal with this object.
